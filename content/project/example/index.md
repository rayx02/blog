- PART 1: Structure of 2022 PP REPORT

Your MYP personal project report should demonstrate your engagement with your personal project by summarizing the experiences and skills recorded throughout the process and be presented succinctly. 

The report should be presented in three sections, based on the objectives and strands (a) planning, (b) applying skills, and (c) reflecting and provide evidence for all the strands of all criteria.

Max 15 pages (5 pages for each section)

- PART 2: Requirements of 2022 PP REPORT

Other requirements laid out in the Personal Project Guide:

    To ensure that the written part of the report is clearly legible, each page must have a minimum 11-point font size and 2 cm margins.

    Evidence presented in images must be clearly visible at the size submitted.

    Audio and video must be recorded and submitted in real-time.

    The bibliography is uploaded separately and is not included in the page limit.

    Please do not include a title page; if included, it will count towards the page limit.
